    "Having thoroughly trained, Akira and Suisei ventured out into the wilderness beyond the town. They set course for the west, to the lands of JerSeykai, where the villain sat safe in his castle."
    "Little did they know that someone else was waiting to spring a trap upon them from the shadow of a tree."
    child_akira "…So I should keep working on my defensive technique because it feels like I keep getting hit in my blind spots, and-"

    child_ivy "HA-HA!! I’ve been waiting for you two!"
    both_1 "(screams)"
    child_akira "Wha-… wait, what the fuck? Ivy?? What are you doing here? And who are those girls following you around?"

    child_ivy "Of course you know me. I’m Ivy (Motherfuckin’) Oak."
    fangirls "Ooooh!"

    child_ivy "and I’m on a quest to stomp every unsuspecting Pokemon trainer in my path!!"
    child_akira "HUH?? Pokemon trainer?"
    child_suisei "(trying desperately trying to hold in her laughter.)"
    child_akira "I-I think there might be some sorta mistake here, um… (whispering to Suisei) Hey Suisei, what’s up with Ivy? Is he normally like this?"
    child_suisei "I… have no idea… Maybe he’s just tripping his ass off right now…"
    child_ivy "IT DOESN’T MATTER! You know the unspoken rule between fellow Trainers: if our eyes meet, we must battle!! Squirtle, get ready!"
    squirtle "SQUIRTLE!"
    child_akira "Ummmm, Ivy, I don’t think this is a great idea! We don’t even have any Pokemon!"
    child_suisei "Oh, it’s fine! We oughta knock this guy down a peg or two - I mean, he’s calling himself Ivy (Motherfuckin’) Oak, and even has a stupid little fan club following him around. Let me take him on!"
    child_akira "OOOKAY then, I guess we’re doing this now! Uhh - Suisei, I choose you!!"

    child_ivy "Haha, you are quite the tough one, my friend. But I ain’t done yet! Raticate, I choose you! (pulls out metrocard) Wait… huh?"
    child_akira "Uhh, isn’t that a MetroCard? Why are you carrying that around in this world?"

    child_ivy "This? I… don’t know… it’s just something that’s always been sitting uselessly in my pocket, but for some reason I’ve never had the heart to throw it away… I’ve just got this feeling that it belongs to someone…" 
    child_ivy "...important to me…" 
    "Ivy looked up and furrowed his brows at Akira, as if trying desperately to remember something."

    child_akira "…I… see… Well, to be honest, I don’t really want to fight you, because you remind me of one of my best friends! How about you join our team? We’re on our way to defeat the villain of this world, and we need all the strength that we can get! So, truce?"
    child_ivy "Hmm… well, what’s in it for me?"
    child_akira "Uhh, well I’m sure that if you joined us you’d become a much stronger Pokemon trainer, especially if we defeat the villain. I mean, if we stomp the villain, then there’s nobody else we can’t stomp, right?"
    child_ivy "I like the way you think, my friend!"
    child_ivy "...Maybe it was my fate to run into you guys eventually…"
    child_akira "So, what’s it gonna be?"
    child_ivy "Sure, I’ll join you guys on your silly little journey! Sorry, girls. Ivy has to go on a big quest with these two. Smell ya later!"
    fangirls "Awww."
    "The fan club departed and Ivy turned back around to greet his new traveling partners."

    child_ivy "I guess we’re a team now. Consider yourselves lucky, cuz it’s not easy to find someone as strong as me!"

    child_akira "Alright, whatever you say, man!"
    child_suisei "Hmph, consider *yourself* lucky that I held back from beating you up back there!"
