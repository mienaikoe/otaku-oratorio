    "The group spotted a clearing in the trees. Sensing danger, or maybe fun, Ivy scouted ahead."
    child_ivy "It's, an ocean? Wait what's that boat doing over there?"
    "In the water about a hundred paces out was a caravel with a wood-carving of a sheep's head on the front. Ivy started to look for people while Akira and Suisei caught up with him. Suisei walked forward and produced a telescope from her bag."
    child_suisei "No one onboard. I wonder where they went."
    child_ivy "While you guys figure that out, I'm taking a dip. Last one in's a soggy bowl of rame-!"

    "Suisei held her arm out to stop him, and pointed toward a nearby ravine where a crowd was gathered."

    "Suddenly, a dust cloud appeared in the ravine and a big boom passed over them not long after. Akira and Ivy cowered in fear behind Suisei."

    child_suisei "Akira, can you swim?"

    child_akira "Are you crazy? What if they see us?"
    child_suisei "That's a yes. Ivy?"

    "She looked toward Ivy, who reached for a pokeball, and unleashed Squirtle."

    "Another explosion rocked the air, coming from the ravine again. The people there look agitated, as does Ivy who clung to Squirtle for dear life."

    "With ease, Akira and Suisei made it to the ship and rested on deck. Ivy, on the other hand, was struggling to make it up the ladder."

    child_ivy "Squirtle! Why aren't you helping me up?"
    squirtle "Squir… tle…"

    "Suisei squeezed the water from her hair and composed herself. With a deft hand motion, she levitated squirtle into her arms and softly set him onto the deck."

    "She went to the railing to observe Ivy and found him swinging on an unstable ladder halfway up, his feet unable to find a foothold."

    child_ivy "Help!"
    child_suisei "Looks like you're having some trouble. Well good luck with that!"
    child_ivy "Sui!"
    child_suisei "What's the magic phrase?"
    child_ivy "WHAT?!"
    child_suisei "Come on, don't be bashful."
    child_ivy "Uhh. “Suisei is the best”?"

    child_suisei "Suisei is the what?"

    "Ivy yelped and his hands began to slip, but Suisei caught his hand just in time. She hoisted him onto the deck and he collapsed."

    "Unbeknownst to them, a curious group of ship-mousing cats had gathered around, staring at these new adventurers."

    child_suisei "Oh my stars, they're so cute."

    "Suisei approached them, but it was a bit too fast for their liking and they darted away from her. Akira stayed sitting, and reached out a hand to a cat near him. Suddenly, a cat in the back turned on a boombox and a song began."
