    "Let us now fast-forward thirteen years, to October of 2025, as we find our three friends at a karaoke bar in Manhattan. Akira was noticeably more quiet and reserved than before, especially when compared to his two livelier friends."

    "They sat down at a bar together where Suisei and Ivy were having an animated discussion, bickering playfully while Akira simply looked on." 

    adult_ivy "...Hahaha! That's hilarious. Right, Akira?" 

    adult_akira "...Oh. Yeah, haha, that's great."

    adult_ivy "…You still doing okay? You've been a little quiet this whole time."

    adult_akira "I'm okay. Just a bit tired from work and being an adult and all that."

    adult_suisei "Oof, felt that one. We’re always here if you wanna talk about it, okay?"

    "Suisei put a hand on Akira's shoulder. Akira blushed."

    adult_akira "Y-Yeah."

    "Ivy moved in closer and slung an arm around Akira's shoulder."

    adult_ivy "Yeah man, we'll always be here for you. Especially me."

    adult_akira "Jeez, dude, when did you become such a sap?"

    adult_ivy "What can I say? I wear my heart on my sleeve."

    adult_suisei "Awwww, how precious."

    adult_suisei "Ooh, I love this song! Let's sing this one, guys!"

    lyrics """
    I am only me, you are only you\nI said that last night and still feel the same way

    You in your gray jacket with that familiar coffee stain\nJust as you always are\nOur reflection in the display window

    Stay with me\nKnocking on midnight's door\nBegging you not to go home\nThat season is right in front of my eyes

    Stay with me\nSaying our favourite words\nHolding on to our little moment\nI'll never forget it as long as I live

    They say love and affection are two different things\nYou told me last night\nSometimes I think so too

    Winter comes again and your heart has gone away\nIf I look back I see\nThat I could always feel you by my sidе

    Stay with me\nKnocking on midnight's door\nThere's a holе in my heart\nThat season is right in front of my eyes

    Stay with me\nDistracted by my loneliness\nThe needle on my record player\nWas stuck on a repeating melody

    "The song ended and Akira looked around. Suisei seemed to be flirting with Ivy - playfully smacking him on the shoulder, leaning on him while laughing, a faint glow apparent on her cheeks. Ivy was oblivious to her advances and started teasing her."

    "Akira backed away toward the door."

    adult_akira "Sorry, guys, I've gotta go. See ya."

    adult_ivy "Wait- Hey, Akira! Why are you in such a rush?"

    "Ivy shrugged off Suisei and turned to look at her."

    adult_ivy "Something's wrong with Akira. Let me go after him. Could you stay behind and take care of our check and stuff?"

    adult_suisei "O-Oh, okay! Catch me up on what happened later!"
