    "Let us now fast-forward thirteen years, as we find our three friends at a karaoke bar in Manhattan. Akira was noticeably more quiet and reserved than before, especially when compared to his two livelier friends."

    "They sat down at a bar together where Suisei and Ivy were having an animated discussion, bickering playfully while Akira simply looked on." 

    adult_ivy "...Hahaha! That’s hilarious. Right, Akira?" 

    adult_akira "...Oh. Yeah, haha, that’s great."

    adult_ivy "…You still doing okay? You’ve been a little quiet this whole time."

    adult_akira "I’m okay. Just a bit tired from work and being an adult and all that."

    adult_suisei "Boy, I feel that one. Just know that we’re always here if you wanna talk, okay?"

    "Suisei put a hand on Akira’s shoulder. Akira blushed."

    adult_akira "Y-Yeah."

    "Ivy moved in closer and slung an arm around Akira’s shoulder."

    adult_ivy "Yeah man, we’ll always be here for you. Especially me."

    adult_akira "Jeez, dude, when did you become such a sap?"

    adult_ivy "What can I say? I wear my heart on my sleeve."

    adult_suisei "Awwww, how precious."

    adult_suisei "Ooh, I love this song! Let’s sing this one, guys!"

    "Suisei pulled both of them by the hand and they all got on the dance floor while Miki Matsubara sang her heart out."

    "The song ended and Akira looked around. Suisei seemed to be flirting with Ivy - playfully smacking him on the shoulder, leaning on him while laughing, a faint glow apparent on her cheeks. Ivy was oblivious to her advances and started teasing her."

    "Akira backed away toward the door."

    adult_akira "Sorry, guys, I’ve gotta go. See ya."

    "He started walking briskly out of the bar, leaving his friends stunned."

    adult_ivy "Wait- Hey, Akira! Why are you in such a rush?"

    "Ivy shrugged off Suisei and turned to look at her."

    adult_ivy "Something’s wrong with Akira. Let me go after him. Could you stay behind and take care of our check and stuff?"

    adult_suisei "O-Oh, okay! Catch me up on what happened later!"
