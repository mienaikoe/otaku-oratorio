    "At last, our adventurers found themselves at their destination. The castle stood tall in the cloudy moonlight, as if to challenge the very sky above it."

    "They anchored the ship and lowered themselves on a dinghy, waving to the cats that had been their companions for this last leg of their journey."

    child_akira "Goodbye strange cats. Enjoy the fish!"

    "The cats were too busy eating fish that Akira and Ivy had caught for them to notice them leaving."

    child_ivy "We’ll be back! …We’ll be back, right?"
    child_suisei "We’ve come this far. Whether we return or not, we gotta keep moving."

    "Akira and Ivy turned around and joined Suisei, each taking a hand. With a glance at Ivy and a flustered look, she shook off their hands and walked away. The two exchanged confused glances, then ran off to follow her."

    "Once inside the castle, they found themselves in a dark entryway. Two sconces with unlit torches guarded the front door. Suisei took one and handed the other to Ivy. "

    "A rustling sound could be heard in the distance."

    child_suisei "Shh."

    "Suddenly, a ghoul jumped out of the dark in front of Akira."

    child_suisei "Be gone! "

    "Suisei threw her torch at the ghastly figure, and it caught fire and let out a huge shriek, knocking her back."

    "With a swift strike Akira sliced into the ghoul, dispatching it with his sword and it disintegrated into the air."

    child_ivy "Yea, get fucked, evil shadow thing."
    child_akira "Are you ok?"
    child_suisei "Hand me my torch, would you?"

    child_suisei "I’ll be fine. Let’s keep moving."

    "The group ventured further into the castle, and with every step, the place was getting quieter and darker."

    child_akira "I’ve got an eerie feeling about this."
    child_ivy "Don’t worry Akira, I’ve got your back."
    child_suisei "Until a pokemon appears."
    child_ivy "Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?"
    child_suisei "Wow, is that a vulpix?"
    child_ivy "Where?!"

    "Suddenly a rumbling sound trembled the ground below them. In front of them, a door swung wide open and revealed a towering ballroom with burning candelabras lining the walls."

    "A strange figure with armor and a helmet entered the doorway."

    stranger "New visitors? Funny, I don’t recall asking for new servants."

    child_suisei  "We are NOT your servants. You’ve been terrorizing this land for too long. We’ve come to serve justice."

    stranger "Justice? I suppose you still believe in the truth as well. Justice is nothing but a figment - a dream amongst the nightmares of reality."

    "Suisei began to use her magic to spin her torch, growing the flame, but the strange figure snapped his fingers and the torch’s flame grew out of control and exploded, separating the three."

    stranger "Oh you’ve come to fight, have you?"
    child_ivy  "We’ve come to kick your ass! Squirtle, go!"
    squirtle "-tle!"

    "Squirtle jumped and landed on Ivy’s back, and with a big heave, he used Water Gun as Ivy ran toward the stranger."

    "To Ivy’s surprise, the stranger pulled out a long sword and pointed it straight at him. Ivy stopped in his tracks narrowly avoiding the tip. "

    "The stranger laughed maniacally as he pulled out another identical sword."

    "Akira readied himself."

    child_akira "We’ve come to end this."
