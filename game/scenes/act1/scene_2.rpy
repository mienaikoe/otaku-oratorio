    "Ivy ran out of the bar and down the sidewalk after Akira."
    adult_ivy "Akira! Hey, wait up!"
    "Akira stopped walking, but refused to turn around. Ivy stopped a few feet behind."
    adult_ivy "Did something happen back there? Or, honestly, you’ve seemed pretty down for the whole day - is the old stuff coming back to haunt you again?"
    adult_akira "…Sorry, I don’t really wanna talk about it right now."
    adult_ivy "…Well, alright. I won’t force ya. But I do just wanna say that Suisei and I have been really worried about you. Ever since all... *that* happened, you’ve never been the same, which is understandable, but… it’s been years, and we thought by now we’d have the old Akira back."
    "Akira was silent."
    adult_ivy "Akira… please, talk to me. It feels like we’re strangers. What happened to the Akira I know?"
    adult_akira "…He’s gone. I killed him."
    adult_ivy "What… What are you saying, dude? Cut the bullshit--"
    adult_akira "Sorry, man. Just… please leave me alone."
    "Akira ran away, dropping a MetroCard in the process. Ivy bent down to pick it up."
    adult_ivy "Dude, you dropped something! Hey--"
    "But when he looked up, Akira was halfway down the street. Realizing he was already out of earshot, he heaved a big sigh of frustration. After staring at the MetroCard for a while, he pocketed it."

    "Akira unwittingly walked into the street. Just then, Ivy caught sight of him half a block away."
    "Around the corner, a bus was approaching, but Akira didn’t seem to notice the bright lights that were headed toward him."
    adult_ivy "Akira, look out!"
