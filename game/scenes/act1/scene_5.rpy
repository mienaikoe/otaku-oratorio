    "Suisei led the way to a lone witch’s hut in the middle of the forest. As they approached the front door, she came to a halt, then turned around to face Akira."
    child_suisei "This is where I live. I’m actually kind of a famous witch around these parts, and a lot of people seek me out for magic advice or potion-making."
    child_akira "Woah, that’s incredible!"
    child_suisei "Hehe, thanks! You said you wanted to become stronger, right? Well, I can teach you the basics of how to fight and some special anti-evil magic attacks!"

    lyrics """
    I’m sure that the heart I left behind\nStill lies hidden in the heart of the deep forest\nExhausted, without the strength to search\nFor people who vanish into the infinite darkness

    Can I even see something if it’s so small?

    As we live on, we lose a little bit more\nShrouded in falsehoods and lies\nWe stand frozen to one place\nUnable to cry out loud

    lyrics """
    The days pass by and change\nWithout us realizing how blue the sky really is\nOvercoming that false scheme, we live in the present\nAnd our rusted hearts begin to beat again

    If we can find the rhythm of time, we can fly one more time

    Let’s live wondering\nTill the world ends\nBelieve in you, I begin my journey by your side\nIn search of light
