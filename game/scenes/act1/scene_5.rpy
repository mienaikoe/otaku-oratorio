    "Suisei led the way to a lone witch’s hut in the middle of the forest. As they approached the front door, she came to a halt, then turned around to face Akira."
    child_suisei "This is where I live. I’m actually kind of a famous witch around these parts, and a lot of people seek me out for magic advice or potion-making."
    child_akira "Woah, that’s incredible!"
    child_suisei "Hehe, thanks! You said you wanted to become stronger, right? Well, I can teach you the basics of how to fight, and show you some special magic-infused attacks that are especially effective against the Villain!"
