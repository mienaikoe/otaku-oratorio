    "Now, I hear you all asking, “Wait a second my beautiful, smart, funny narrator… did the main character just die halfway through the first act?”"

    "And first, I’ll say… “Thank you, you’re so charming.” And to answer your question, I’d like to remind you that we are the Otaku Choir. And we take our isekai narratives quite seriously."

    "So, come with me as we find Akira passed out on the branch of a tree in a bustling JRPG town, no longer in his adult form, but… smaller."

    "A small cloaked figure approached, dressed in a witch’s hat and armed with a staff made surely for sorcery."
    child_suisei "Wow, that’s an awful position to sleep in. Hmmmm."
    "She spent a few moments staring intently at the prone Akira, walking this way and that around him."
    child_suisei "…Guess I’ll help him out!"
    "She focused a little, then tapped the ground with her staff, levitating Akira off the tree and into the air."
    child_suisei "Let’s go find someplace nearby - can’t hold this levitation spell for that long!"
    "The girl made haste to the local JRPG inn, trying her best to hide the floating body of Akira."
    "At last she found a bed and set him down upon it, finding a nearby chair from which to read her newly borrowed spellbook while she waited for Akira to come to. She would occasionally glance over at Akira to check that he was still breathing."

    "Akira slowly blinked open his eyes."
    child_akira "…Ugh… Where am I?"
    child_suisei "Finally awake?"
    child_akira "…Huh, Sui? Why are we here- wait, why are you wearing that weird witch cosplay? And why are you… {i}smaller??{/i}"
    child_suisei "Umm… not sure what you’re talking about? I’ve always looked like this. And how do you know my name, anyway?"
    child_akira "What do you mean, of {i}course{/i} I know your name- hang on… Something’s weird about me too. Has my voice always sounded this high? Sui, could you grab me a mirror real quick?"
    child_suisei "Sure, whatever gets you out of your tizzy."
    "She passes him the mirror on the bedside table."
    child_akira "…Huh, I was right. I {i}am{/i} younger. And so are you."
    "He tosses aside the mirror and stares defeatedly at Sui, having already lost the energy to question the current situation he was in."
    child_suisei "…Right. It does appear that I am about the same age as you."
    child_akira "No duh. Anyway, could you explain to me where we are? I feel like I’ve just been transported into an alternate universe, and I have no idea what’s going on."
    child_suisei "Haha, what am I, your tutorial? Just kidding. This is Ii Sekai, a world with magic and monsters. Oh, and there’s this big evil villain who is plotting something sinister in his lair."
    child_suisei "I am just your ordinary passing witch, though, so there’s nothing I alone can do against this imminent threat. How terrible."
    child_akira "Wow, you’re so nonchalant about that villain thing… Umm, do you think I was sent here to defeat this villain or whatever?"
    child_suisei "Perhaps. It doesn’t seem like you belong to this world… Hmm, yeah! I get the feeling you were sent here to lead the group of heroes who will take down the villain! Umm, what was your name again?"
    child_akira "It’s Akira…"
    child_suisei "Akira! This could be your destiny!"
    child_akira "Oh wow, you really think so? Well, I don’t know what else I’d be doing here otherwise, so if you say so, then I must be one of those heroes! All right! Let’s do this!"
    "Akira got out of bed with renewed vigor and walked straight out the door. Shocked at his incredible recovery, Suisei stumbled after him."
    child_suisei "Wait, you’ve decided that quickly? Hang on a sec-"
    "Before she could stop him, Akira opened the door and marched confidently outside."

    "He looked up, and saw darkness across the sky. The townspeople fled into their homes in terror."
    "Akira approached a glowing cloud that lingered in the air in front of him."
    child_suisei "Akira, don’t touch that!"
    child_akira "Why, what’s it--?"

    "With a jolt of lightning, Akira was flung backward, and a swarm of ghouls sprawled across the city. They began to unleash havoc upon the town, tearing apart buildings and constructing walls and towers in their place."

    "Suisei and Akira prepared to fight."

    lyrics """
    Even though clear blue winds\nBeat on the door of my heart,\nYou just smile, looking straight at me
    
    Too involved in yearning for\nSomething to hold on to\nThe innocent eyes still know nothing of fate yet.

    But someday you will notice\nOn those shoulders of yours\nThere are strong wings\nTo guide you to the far future.

    A cruel angel's thesis\nWill someday fly high from the window\nIf memories are betrayed by\nThe overflowing, burning pathos.

    Young boy, shine like a legend,\nHolding the sky in your arms.

    lyrics """
    The cradle of love that sleeps within me\nThere will be a morning that\nA servant of dreams will come for you.

    The moonlight shines on your thin neckline\nI'd stop time in this world\nAnd lock it away for myself, but...

    If there is any meaning\nIn the fate that pulled us together,\nThen I am, yes, the Bible\nThat teaches you of freedom.

    A cruel angel's thesis\nAnd then sorrow comes forth\nWhen the shapes of the dreams you hold in your arms\nCome to life within you.

    Young boy, who shines brighter than anyone else,\nRise to become a legend!

    People weave together love to create history\nAnd so I live on,\nUnable to become a goddess...

    A cruel angel's thesis\nWill someday fly high from the window\nIf memories are betrayed by\nThe overflowing, burning pathos.

    Young boy, shine like a legend,\nHolding the sky in your arms.

    child_akira "I thought I was going to die back there."

    child_suisei "And you honestly might’ve, if I hadn’t stepped in to help you out."
    child_akira "Thanks for saving my butt, Suisei. What kind of person would do this?"
    child_suisei "There’s only one person it could be."
    child_akira "Ughh. This was the villain’s work? Oh man… How am I gonna be able to defeat him when I’m this weak?"

    child_suisei "…Hmm, I might know a way. Akira, do you want to become stronger?"

    child_akira "…Yes, I do. Do you know how?"
    child_suisei "Yeah, I think so! Come with me!"
    "With a flip of her cloak, she turned around and started walking, catching Akira off guard."

    child_akira "Wha- Sui?? Hey, wait up!"
