    "Akira was laid up in a hospital bed, bandaged all over and hooked up to all sorts of machines."

    "The nurse entered to check his vitals on the machine. She fluffed his pillows and tucked him in."

    nurse "You okay? Hanging in there?" 

    nurse "Your friends were out there all night. The loud one kept blaming himself, said he wasn’t fast enough. The girl kept saying “I’m not crying”. She was totally crying." 

    nurse "Stick with it. Your friends are waiting for you."
