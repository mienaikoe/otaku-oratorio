    "The year was 2012. The Olympics were in London, Obama was about to be re-elected, and the timeline still kind of made sense."

    "It is upon this backdrop that we discover our heroes for today. Three kids - Akira, Suisei, and Ivy - were enjoying their last weeks of their summer break, lounging in the living room to play the Nintendo Wii, as was customary at the time." 
    
    "Ivy’s phone played a notification tone from “Gangnam Style” as was also customary at the time."

    child_ivy "Yooooo, my status got eight likes, that’s basically viral."

    child_suisei "(giggling) Lol, tell me your ways senpai."

    "Suisei was sitting a little too close to Ivy. Akira noticed."

    child_akira "Yeah… it was pretty cool I guess. Is that the one that said “I’m the best thing since sliced anime”?"

    child_suisei "...What does that even mean?"

    "Ivy stood up and sat next to Akira."

    child_ivy "Yo bro… that was posted like, yesterday, that wasn’t the one today. You never like my statuses bro!"

    child_akira "I mean y’know, I saw it when it said “posted 2 hours ago” and I thought it was too late so I didn’t like it but– "
