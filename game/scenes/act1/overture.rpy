    "The year was 2012. The Olympics were in London, Obama was about to be re-elected, and the timeline still kind of made sense."

    "It is upon this backdrop that we discover our heroes for today. Three kids - Akira, Suisei, and Ivy - were enjoying their last weeks of their summer break, lounging in the living room to play the Nintendo Wii, as was customary at the time." 
    
    "Ivy's phone played a notification tone from “Gangnam Style” as was also customary at the time."

    child_ivy "Yooooo, my status got eight likes, that's basically viral."

    child_suisei "Lol, tell me your ways senpai."

    "Suisei was sitting a little too close to Ivy. Akira noticed."

    child_akira "Yeah… it was pretty cool I guess. Is that the one that said “I'm the best thing since sliced anime”?"

    child_suisei "...What does that even mean?"

    "Ivy stood up and sat next to Akira."

    child_ivy "Yo bro... that was posted like, yesterday, that wasn't the one today. You never like my statuses bro!"

    child_akira "I mean y'know, I saw it when it said “posted 2 hours ago” and I thought it was too late so I didn't like it but– "

    child_ivy "Ah no worries bro, you're just overthinking it again."

    child_akira "So Suisei, did you get that quiz result I sent you? It said that our friendship is like Mario and Peach. You think they're a good couple right? I think they're a good matc–"

    child_suisei "–Actually no, it's never been confirmed they're canonically together, also it's just a Smash Bros, it's not that deep."

    child_akira "Oh... uhh okay..."
    
    child_akira "I guess I'm just going to be #ForeverAlone."

    child_suisei "What was that?"

    child_akira "Oh, i-it's nothing!"

    "Suisei, feeling kinda aggro, grabbed a controller."

    child_suisei "Can we go back to playing Smash?"

    child_akira "Oh yeah."

    "Ivy and Akira both reached for their controllers too."

    child_ivy "It's time to d-d-d-d-duel, worthy opponent… the Naruto to my Sasuke… The Ash to my Gary… the Mario to my Bowse–"

    child_akira "W-What's the score between us again? Me: 99 wins to your 5 matches?"

    child_suisei "Cool your bromance guys, I'm beating you both."
