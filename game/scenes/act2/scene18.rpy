    lyrics """
    We who are one\n
    
    Hither and thither\nWe scatter\nWe flutter\n
    
    We sparkle\nWe startle\nWe remember\n

    Each of us\nOne by one\nWe fly home again\n
    
    Yes, we return\nTo our birthplace of light

    Twinkling, shimmering\nLuminescent, we become again\nAs one
