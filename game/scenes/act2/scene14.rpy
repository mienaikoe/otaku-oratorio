    "The next morning, the two decided to travel to Suisei's old witch hut to gather supplies for their adventure back to the Villain's castle. They reminisced about their old adventures as they traveled their old trails."

    lyrics """
    Far away, on the other side, is a sleeping person\nIf you close your eyes, it spreads out\nThe gentle voice of that day\n

    It seems like eternal light is returning to the earth\nUntil it reaches the forgiveness of the earth\n

    Believe in living together\nAnd in the strength that is born\n

    Look up, even if you go far away\nA love that binds hearts into one, a sky of hope\n

    "Suisei opened the door to her hut, with Ivy ducking in behind her, leaving it slightly ajar for light."

    "In the corner, a fire-lit silhouette was huddled behind a cloth. Suisei stopped in her tracks and slowly moved toward the silhouette with her hands up for a magic spell."

    teen_suisei "Who's there?"

    "The silhouette peeked behind the cloth."

    mother "Just little old me. Would you two like some tea?"

    "Suisei was shocked. She opened her mouth to protest, but Ivy spoke before her."

    teen_ivy "Oh. Yes we'd love some. Wouldn't we, Sui."
    teen_suisei "What are you doing here?"
    mother "Oh, I've been searching for my son for such a long time. I just needed a place to rest. I'm sorry if I've alarmed you."
    teen_ivy "What my friend here is trying to say is, we'd love to learn more about you. You must have stories from all your travels."
    mother "You want to hear my stories?"
    teen_ivy  "Of course."
    teen_suisei "Why don't you start with your name?"

    "The mysterious woman handed them both cups of tea."

    mother "Oh yes, I apologize. My name is… well that's irrelevant in a place like this… you can just call me Adventure Mom. I've been searching for my son for quite a long time now."
    teen_ivy "What can you tell us about your son? Maybe we've seen him?"
    mother "Akira? What is there to say? He's kind, but I'm so worried he may be troubled because of me."
    teen_suisei  "You're Akira's Mom?!"
    mother "So you know of him? You must be lucky. He loved his friends like they were family. I've been looking for him for so long."
    teen_suisei "I'm… so sorry. I…"
    teen_ivy "Why don't you travel with us? We may know where he is."
    mother "Oh, thank you but I'm much too tired from my journey. Perhaps I'm not meant to find him. Perhaps it was meant for you two."
    teen_ivy "So, hypothetically, if your son was captured by a super-powerful villain with crazy long swords and a well-thought-out plan, how exactly would you go about rescuing him?"
    mother "Well you have quite the imagination."
    teen_ivy "Yea… Imagination…"

    "Ivy shuffled uneasily and clutched the metrocard in his pocket. The woman spotted the metrocard and her eyes opened wide."

    mother "Oh, you have a metrocard?"
    teen_ivy "This? Oh I think I found it just a little bit before I ran into Akira and Suisei. I can't shake the feeling that this will be important one day."
    mother "You know, I've been to a cave somewhere far down a long pass through the mountains. I met a magician there once that made all my dreams come true."
    mother "But I lost track of him when I went on this quest. I don't know if he's still down there but he'll surely help you along your journey if he is."
    teen_ivy "Sui, maybe we should check that out."
    teen_suisei "Maybe. Let's prepare for a long journey then."

    "The two hurried to pack as Akira’s mom told them stories from Akira’s childhood."

    "Once they’d finished packing, they turned to her to say goodbye."

    mother "If you’re ever in trouble, there’s a special kind of magic in that card of yours. Don’t forget to ask for help."
    teen_ivy "Thank you. I’ll remember that."

    "And with a reverent bow, the two left the hut and started on a new adventure into the mountains."
