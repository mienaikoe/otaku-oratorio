    "Akira lay in a hospital bed, wondering if he was still alive. He opened his eyes, then moved his arms and toes."

    adult_akira "Am I dead?"
    
    "Ivy and Suisei, who were sitting next to Akira, jolted awake at the sound of his voice."

    adult_suisei "Akira!"
    adult_akira "Why do I feel like I got hit by a bus?"
    adult_ivy "Well… you kinda did get hit by a bus."
    adult_suisei "Yea your body flew to like a different realm."
    adult_akira "I saw you two in my dream. You were dressed funny, and we were fighting."
    adult_ivy "How did I look?"
    adult_akira "Pretty sick. Hey, we should go to the gym sometime."
    adult_suisei "Was I a badass?"

    lyrics"""
    I chased after rabbits on that mountain.\nI fished for minnow in that river.\nI still dream of those days even now\nOh, how I miss my old country home.\n
   
    Father and mother―are they doing well?\nIs everything well with my old friends?\nWhen the rain falls, when the wind blows,\nI stop and recall of my old country home.\n

    Some day when I have done what I set out to do,\nI'll return home one of these days\nWhere the mountains are green, my old country home,\nWhere the waters are clear, my old country home.\n
    """
