    "Akira lay in a hospital bed, wondering if he was still alive. He opened his eyes, then moved his arms and toes."

    adult_akira "Am I dead?"
    
    "Ivy and Suisei, who were sitting next to Akira, jolted awake at the sound of his voice."

    adult_suisei "Akira!"
    adult_akira "Why do I feel like I got hit by a bus?"
    adult_ivy "Wellâ€¦ you kinda did get hit by a bus."
    adult_suisei "Yea your body flew to like a different realm."
    adult_akira "I saw you two in my dream. You were dressed funny, and we were fighting."
    adult_ivy "How did I look?"
    adult_akira "Pretty sick. Hey, we should go to the gym sometime."
    adult_suisei "Was I a badass?"
    adult_akira "Yea. You were a badass."
