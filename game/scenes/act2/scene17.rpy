    "The castle was in ruins since the last time they were there. The windows were broken, and the torches were all unlit."

    "Suisei took a torch from the wall, added some oil from her bag and lit it with a dagger and a rock from the floor. A thousand spiders crawled away at the bright light."

    teen_suisei "You'd think with all these minion ghost things, one of them could pick up a broom."

    "A minion spirit passed by them, unfazed by their presence. Suisei and Ivy readied their battle stances, but the ghostly figure ignored them. The two looked at each other confused, then eventually put their guards down."

    "They came to the same room where they met the strange figure before. There was no wall of candles this time - they had all gone out."

    teen_ivy "We're back. Let's not stay here for too long -- AHH."

    "Ivy got caught in a spiderweb that was dangling from the ceiling. He struggled, then used the sword to disentangle himself. Suisei helped him get the rest of the webs off."

    teen_suisei "Watch where you're walking in here."

    "Suisei levitated the torch and moved it all around the room, but found nothing. Then she lifted it toward the ceiling and found a dense cluster of spiderwebs. Two red eyes appeared from the darkness."

    teen_suisei "Come out and fight!"

    "The eyes closed and suddenly a being jumped from the ceiling and onto the ground. Akira stood before them, looking haggard and threatening."

    teen_ivy "Oh you got… hairier."
    teen_suisei "That's your takeaway here?"
    teen_akira "You two again. Come to pay your respects?"
    teen_suisei "We want our friend back!"
    teen_akira "He's not coming back. His joy, his optimism. It was dangerous. I had to do something."
    teen_akira "You see, this place. It only lives in his mind. And all of the terrible things happening out there would wreak havoc upon this place, were it not for me."
    teen_akira "Were it not for the walls I put up, the order I instilled, everything would have fallen apart."
    teen_ivy "A-Akira? Is that you?"
    teen_akira "Ivy. Arrogant and clueless as ever. You've always been a thorn in my side."
    teen_akira "And Suisei."
    teen_akira "Well, Ivy just can't get rid of you, can he?"
    teen_suisei "Akira…"

    "Suisei walked slowly toward Akira, and took his hand."

    "He rose and faced her, then she led him onto the bus."
