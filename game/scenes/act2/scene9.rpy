    "The year was 2022. Akira sat alone in the living room, watching anime and scrolling on his phone, as was the custom at the time. The Wii where he used to play with Suisei and Ivy had been collecting dust for years."

    "His mother walked in from another room with a sad look, phone in hand. But upon seeing her son, she perked up."

    mother  "How was school today?"
    teen_akira "Fine, I guess."
    mother "Have you finished any college applications yet?"
    "Akira sighed, then got up and walked to his room while his mother stared into the wall. She called up to him."
    mother  "I have to go to work soon. Dinner's in the fridge."

    "Akira's father opened the door of their home, and took his shoes off, voicing his exhaustion. He opened the fridge and pulled out some food."
    mother "That's Akira's"
    "He switched to leftovers while she finished packing her purse for work. Akira's father put the food down for a moment and kissed her on the forehead."
    father "Do you ever feel like we're just…"
    mother "Spinning a wheel?"
    father "But we're still good, right? I mean… you still feel the spark?"

    "She smiled and turned to him, grabbing his hand, and in this short moment they had together, they danced in the living room."

    lyrics """
    You ask how deeply I love you\nAnd just how great my love is\n

    My affection is real\nAnd my love is true\nThe moon represents my heart\n

    You ask how deeply I love you\nAnd just how great my love is\n

    My affection does not waver\nAnd my love doesn’t change\nThe moon represents my heart\n

    A gentle kiss\nIs enough to move my heart\n

    Such a deep affection\nMakes me long for you now\n

    You ask how deeply I love you\nAnd just how great my love is\n

    Consider this\nAnd look above\nThe moon represents my heart\n
