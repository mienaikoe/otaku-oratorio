    "One day, Akira had it in his mind to take Suisei on a date (or so he thought). He had suggested the arcade to show off his unmatched skill in the world’s finest arcade game."

    scene park

    "They moved to the park, where the cherry blossoms were blowing in the wind. Suisei was holding a plushy that Akira had won for her."

    teen_akira "Hey, uh. I just wanted to talk about something important before we go our separate ways. I’ve wanted to tell you this for a while."
    teen_suisei "Oh of course, you can tell me anything you idiot! (hits him with plushy)"
    teen_akira "(pause) We’ve known each other for a long time, I just get this fuzzy feeling inside (gradually sounds more rushed and anxious), especially when I see you smile or even look at me and I think to myself, “oh god she’s not mad at me or anything like that, right?” "
    teen_akira "I guess what I’m saying is that… it feels like you make my heart smile on the inside and I just think I really like you."
    teen_suisei "(long pause). I… really like you too."
    teen_akira "Oh, so you also?--"
    teen_suisei "– N-not like that. I mean I like you a lot, you mean a lot to me… You’re one of my best friends but… "
    teen_suisei "I’ve only seen you as a friend… It’s not you, it’s me… idiot."
    teen_akira "Oh… Well, at least I tried."
    teen_suisei "(pause) I’m sorry… I just don’t feel the same way as you… But, can we still be friends?"
    teen_akira "Yea…"
