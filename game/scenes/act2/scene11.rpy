    "It was a cloudy day at the funeral."

    "There was a cherry blossom tree casting its petals upon the air like a shadow or a wildfire."

    "It was Akira's turn to speak. He was ready. He had trained for this after all."

    "No crying. He had to be strong for dad."

    teen_akira "My mom used to wake up before sunrise to make my lunch. She'd cut the carrots into stars, and draw a smiley face on the rice with teriyaki sauce."

    teen_akira "She would leave little notes like “Ganbatte” on them. She'd dance with my dad sometimes even when there wasn't any music."

    teen_akira "When things would get bad, she'd remind me that “even the darkness shines too with the stars”."

    teen_akira "I didn't always believe her. But I have to do my best."

    "Akira left the front and his father stepped forward to speak to the crowd that had gathered. But as he tried to talk, the words failed him."

    "So instead, he decided to sing."

    lyrics """
    When my heart is alone\n
    There is a melody that knocks on the door of my memories\n

    I don’t even need to gaze into your eyes\n
    You’re the only one I see\n

    My memories seem like new\n
    You are there even in my dreams\n

    And even if the world changes\n
    I’ll always be here\n

    I may not be meant for you\n
    Still, my heart will not change\n

    There is no one elsе\n
    No one else that I will long for\n

    My lovе is yours (My love is yours)\n
    Until the end\n

    lyrics """
    It’s probably best that I forget about you\n
    My love is like the wind that you never seem to feel (Never seem to feel)\n

    No need to gaze into your eyes\n
    Because you’re the only one I see\n

    Whatever hope I had has disappeared\n
    But my love for you remains\n

    And even if the world changes\n
    I’ll always be here\n

    I may not be meant for you\n
    Still, my heart will not change\n

    There is no one else\n
    No one else that I will long for\n

    My love is yours (My love is yours)\n
    Until the end\n

    If our paths cross then we are meant for each other\n
    Had I said everything then, would things be different now?\n

    With every breath, I pray that I could be with you\n
    And if this is our last moment together, I want you to know that\n

    I love you\n

    I love you\n

    I love you\n
