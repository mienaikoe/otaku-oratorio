    "Suisei and Ivy entered a dark cavern. Across the walls lay spiderwebs, cast across the open air. Hidden behind walls of rock and dirt was the occasional tile or mosaic artwork: A sign that something had been here before."

    "Suisei stopped in front of a larger opening in the wall, and brushed her hand across the tile to try to read what it said."

    teen_suisei  "Times Square? Doesn't look like a square to me."
    teen_ivy "So we're supposed to find something that works with this “Metro” card?"
    teen_suisei "It'll probably be bound with a magic ward, so look for something glowing."

    "Ivy suddenly stumbled upon a rectangular rock. He brushed off dust from the top and found a glowing panel."

    teen_ivy "Like this thing?"

    "Ivy held the card against it, then hit the rock with the card, but nothing happened. He grew frustrated, and set his hand on a slot right above the rock."

    teen_ivy "What was that?"

    "From a far tunnel, a white light appeared, and the rumbling began to get louder."

    teen_ivy "HOLY SHIT WHAT IS THAT DON'T LET IT GET ME!!"

    "The train came in fast, and slowed to a stop, leaving the two in awe. The doors opened, and a fashionable man with a striking resemblance to Akira's father exited the train."

    father "All aboard, you two!"
    teen_suisei "I am Suisei, and this is–"
    teen_ivy "Ivy! We are trying to get to the castle, do you know the way?"
    father "The castle? Why are you going there? (whispering) It's kind of a tourist trap."
    teen_suisei "We want to find our friend."
    teen_ivy "His name's Akira, have you heard of him?"
    father "Ah yes, I know Akira quite well. You'll need to stock up where you're going. Come, I can take you where you need to go."

    "He opened his hands to welcome them aboard."

    teen_ivy "Who are you?"
    father "Akira used to call me dad. So I guess you can call me Akira's Dad."

    "They cautiously walked in, and found themselves in a magical world. A glowing crystal shined in the middle of the train car."

    father "This used to be Akira's. Go ahead."

    "Ivy and Suisei touched the crystal, and the train car filled with a bright blue light. A magical aura overtook Suisei and Ivy."

    lyrics """
    The horizon spreading wide,\n
    it's brightness fills the sky\n
    Why it shines so beautifully?\n
    Because behind it's where you hide.\n
    
    All the yearning that I feel,\n
    for the many lights I see.\n
    Is all because the warmth that they give\n
    reminds me so much of you.\n

    Let our journey start from here,\n
    with a slice of bread you baked.\n
    Everything that you'll need is in your bag,\n
    all you'll need to take.\n

    My father left for me\n
    this flaming soul I feel.\n
    My mother gave to me\n
    this heart with truth I seek.\n

    As the world will make its turn,\n
    it will hide you as it might.\n
    All the twinkle in its eyes,\n
    all the sparkle of it's light.\n

    As the world will make its turn,\n
    it will take you on its wings\n
    One day I know we'll finally see,\n
    on its wings, you and I.\n

    "The two got off the train and waved goodbye to Akira's father as his train rode off into the ether. Suisei looked at her hands, and Ivy looked at his sword."

    teen_ivy "I can do this! I think I can save Akira!"
    teen_suisei "You mean WE."

    "Suisei glanced at Ivy's new muscles, and averted her eyes."

    teen_suisei "I-I guess we should go now."
    teen_ivy "Hey, what's the rush?"
    teen_suisei "It's nothing."
    teen_ivy "Ohhh I see. You see me differently now that I have this awesome gym bod."
    teen_suisei  "It's not that! I mean… No!"
    teen_ivy "Akira needs a strong warrior to save him. I can be his knight in shining armor."
