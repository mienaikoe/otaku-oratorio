    "We return again to the land of Ii-sekai, where we find Suisei, now a teenager, on a small, modest-looking farm."

    "She was busy working the field when it started to rain. She looked up and groaned, throwing her hoe into the ground in frustration."

    teen_suisei "UGH! Ivy, this lifestyle fucking sucks! I wanna fight again!"

    teen_suisei "…Ivy? Where are you?"

    teen_suisei "Ughhh, he's probably piss drunk at the tavern again. Let me go get that loser."

    "At this moment, Ivy was, indeed, piss drunk at the local tavern. He was slouched over his drink at the bar, looking very sad and pathetic."

    "Suddenly, in came Suisei slamming open the tavern door - drawing everyone's attention to her in the process. Spotting her friend at the bar, she marched straight up to him."

    teen_suisei "IVY! Get your shit together already!"

    teen_ivy "…Ugh… is that you, Sui? What do you want now? I'm way too drunk for one of your lectures."

    teen_suisei "You know as well as I do - drinking away your sorrows isn't gonna get you anywhere. I'm tired of waiting - let's go fight that asshole again and bring Akira back!"

    teen_ivy "Hah. That's rich coming from the person who forced us to retreat in the first place."

    teen_suisei "Okay, well my bad for saving your sorry ass! Or did you *want* to die back there?"

    teen_ivy "Of course not!!! But then what are we even supposed to do? Go back for another ass-beating?"

    teen_ivy "And from a guy who looks so much like Akira, too?! Like, does this mean Akira was the villain all along? Are we supposed to kill our friend to save this cursed world??"

    teen_ivy "Please… don't make me kill him…"

    teen_suisei "Look… I get it. I still don't know for sure if that villain actually was Akira. I'm super confused about it as well. But… if he really is Akira, then I want to believe that he wouldn't kill another version of himself."

    teen_suisei "If that Akira still cares for us deep down, then maybe we could talk some sense into him. Or, uh, beat some sense into him before the talking."

    teen_ivy "Okay then, you got any new ideas on how to not get obliterated by evil Akira? Cause I sure don't."

    teen_suisei "Honestly? I really don't. Kinda just banking on our luck and the power of friendship here. But at this point, anything is better than sitting here and watching the world slowly crumble away."

    teen_ivy "Haha, do you think evil Akira would at least be nice to me after he destroys the world? Maybe I could be his favorite little demon sidekick-"

    teen_suisei "Ooookay, come on, let's get you home. You're so annoying when you're drunk."

    "With a huff, Suisei hoisted the keeled-over Ivy onto his feet and practically dragged him back to their farm."
